    <div>With a string of high-profile live shows under their belt, and an immediate future that sees them join the likes of Foo Fighters on select dates and appear at Reading & Leeds Festivals at the end of August, here’s what you need to know about British emo-powerpop four-piece Hot Milk.</div>
    <div><u><Strong>Hot Milk</Strong></u> are co-vocalists Jim Shaw and Han Mee, bassist Tom Paton and drummer Harry Deller, calling Manchester, UK their home.</div>
    <div>Self-described as emo-powerpop, Hot Milk aren’t afraid to look back to power their future. Debut EP Are You Feeling Alive? brims with energetic pop hooks and pop-punk vocals that propel the mid-00s heyday of emo into 2019. Its upbeat, riff-driven sound is both reinvigorating and downright catchy; undoubtedly a catalyst for their abundant festival appearances across the summer.</div>
    <div><p style="margin-top:40px;">With only one EP to their name, Manchester’s Hot Milk have already garnered an impressive live career. Their catchy hooks have seen them join You Me At Six, Deaf Havana and more on the road, and have caught the attention of global megastars Foo Fighters. Their summer has seen them take to stages at Slam Dunk Festival, Truck Festival and – at the time of writing – will see them perform at the iconic Reading & Leeds Festival across the August bank holiday weekend.</p>
    <p>Their live shows have been celebrated for their sheer energy, and the delivery of hits such as their vibrant debut single Awful Ever After and EP highlight Wide Awake. Not bad for a band who have existed for less than two years.</p>
    <p>Hot Milk formed following a decision by friends and co-workers Han Mee and Jim Shaw to take on a new challenge. Both worked in the music industry, Han putting on shows and Jim as a lighting technician in live venues, but not satisfied with their behind the scenes jobs they joined Tom Paton and Harry Deller to take centre stage. Bringing together their vast tastes from across the world of music, Hot Milk went into the studio with a focused desire to create ear-worms, and that they did.</p>    
    <p>From the pop-heavy Wide Awake to the guitar-driven Awful Ever After and the buoyant Take Your Jacket, the band’s big choruses and melodic prowess offer early, and rightful, comparisons to their already stellar touring partners.</p></div>
